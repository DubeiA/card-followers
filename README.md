The website at https://dubeia.github.io/card-followers/ appears to be a simple
web application that generates a fake social media profile page with a follower
count and some basic information.

In general, this is a small test site that receives data from the mockAPI and
creates cards with fictional users, displaying random values ​​of tweets and
followers, and interactively subscribing to them with followers increasing when
you subscribe or decreasing when you unsubscribe.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run deploy`

Is a command that you can run to deploy your application to a remote server or
hosting platform. When you run this command, npm will execute the deploy script
defined in your package.json file. This script can contain any number of
commands to deploy your application to your desired destination.

Deploying your app is important because it allows your application to be
accessible to users. By deploying your app, you make it available on the
internet, where users can access it from anywhere. Additionally, deploying your
app can also help you test and debug your code in a production-like environment,
which can help catch issues before they affect your users.
